  "body": "### Night Events\r\n\r\n**Movie Night**: Every Friday night, we will use a video application (from plug.dj to Hydrocity's own app) and watch a movie with a time length of 1-2 hours. Before Movie night commences, we will have a poll of the movies that certain staff members have chosen, in which they are public in YouTube. The most voted option will be the movie for that night. Do not worry if you didn't get to watch the movie you advised, as you can vote for it again if it is chosen in the poll before Movie night.\r\n\r\n**Anime Night**: Every weekend, we will schedule a time in which we will use a Video Application and watch a few episodes of a specific anime. We will have a poll to decide what anime to watch, but then the choices yet again will be chosen by the staff. The most-voted choice will be the anime we will watch for sometime. There are different choices every week, so vote for the best!\r\n\r\n### Event Games\r\n\r\n**Tag Pro**: During the weekend, we will host a Tag Pro webgame, in which there will be a cap of people who can join the game, just to balance out the teams. Remember that this is a competition between Blue and Red in this group. The team that wins the most points not only win the game, but win points that they can use to buy items from the Point Shop.\r\n\r\n**Hax Ball**: During the alternate day before/after Tag Pro is played, we will host a Hax Ball game. We will restrict it with a password so then we can cap the number of players joining the game. Like before, this is a competition between two teams. The team that wins the most points in Hax Ball wins the game, and points from Bellematon.\r\n\r\n",
